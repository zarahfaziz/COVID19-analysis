# COVID-19 Case Analysis (World)


## Project Overview

Purpose: Perform exploratory and in-depth analyses of COVID-19 case data.

Language(s): Python

Tools: Pandas, Plotly



## Importance

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. In 2020, COVID19 was declared a worldwide pandemic, contributing to over 1 million deaths in the United States alone.

The importance of this project is to assess the pandemic data for total cases (active, recovered, and death) caused by COVID19, and to analyze the trends of these cases across the world by looking at the various affected countries / regions.

Performing quantitative analyses may contribute insight into the severity and spread of the disease itself, while additional regional analyses can further help researchers around the world (i.e. World Health Organization) to determine which areas require the most resources to combat COVID19 spread.


## Objective

Perform general exploratory data analysis to assess the case counts in the categories of interest (i.e. active cases, recovered cases, death cases, and the associated ratios to total cases).
Perform in-depth analysis to assess the case counts in various regions of the world in order to determine which areas were most strongly affected by the disease.
